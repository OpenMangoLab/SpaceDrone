# SpaceDrone

## Overview
SpaceDrone is an open-source research project initiated by the OpenMango team. The project aims to gather valuable information such as pictures, weather conditions, pollution levels, temperature, and humidity about a given location by deploying a custom-built drone into the stratosphere. By making the project open-source, our goal is to enable the replication of the system in different parts of the world, facilitating the collection of diverse data sets for research and analysis purposes.

## Objectives
- Gather comprehensive data sets from various locations around the world.
- Study environmental factors such as weather patterns, pollution levels, temperature, and humidity.
- Enable researchers to access and analyze collected data for scientific purposes.
- Promote collaboration and knowledge sharing within the scientific community.

## Features
- Custom-built drone equipped with sensors for data collection.
- Integration with GPS technology for precise location tracking.
- Autonomous flight capabilities for reaching the stratosphere.
- Data transmission systems for real-time or post-flight data retrieval.
- Open-source software and hardware designs for easy replication and modification.
- Documentation and tutorials for setup, deployment, and data analysis.
